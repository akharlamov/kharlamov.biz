![Alexey Kharlamov](/images/akharlamov-avatar.png) 

I am a well travelled Software Engineer who went a path from pre-x86 era computers to the modern distributed deployments
of thousands of CPUs and petabytes of storage.  I worked for small and large companies, co-founded 3 start ups and have 
been part of at least other 4. My career primarily revolves around applications of large-scale distributed systems, 
data/ML architecture and engineering management.

And the moment I am based in London, UK and lead software engineering team at 
[Tailify Software Ltd](https://tailify.com/), where we work on large scale analysis of influence networks.   

I do some consulting work on matters interesting to me _pro-bono_. Do not hesitate to reach out.
